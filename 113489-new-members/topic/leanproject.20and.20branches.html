<p>I have installed leanproject and am trying to create a new branch off master (see <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Bounded.20continuous.20functions/near/197060652" title="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Bounded.20continuous.20functions/near/197060652">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Bounded.20continuous.20functions/near/197060652</a>).  Am I supposed to do this directly with git, or is this process wrapped in a leanproject command (the way that the cloning of projects is)?<br>
I tried to follow the intructions at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools">mathlib-tools readme</a> for simultaneously getting a project and creating a new branch, but when I tried (as instructed) the command <code>leanproject get -b project_name:branch_name</code> (with <code>project_name</code> and <code>branch_name</code> appropriately instantiated), I received the error message <code>Error: no such option: -b</code>.</p>
