<p>I'm trying to import a file that is not part of mathlib, but am getting an error that <code>file 'tuto_lib' not found in the LEAN_PATH</code>. I'm in VSCode and this file is in my current <code>src</code> directory. I've also tried moving it inside mathlib, right next to <code>data</code> (which I am able to open and use) but that still gives me the same error. I tried closing and reopening VSCode, and reloading all the files. </p>
<p>Context: This is on section 5 of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> 's tutorials.</p>

<p>I think if it's at <code>src/subproject/tuto_lib.lean</code> then you can do <code>import subproject.tuto_lib</code> from anywhere<br>
(where of course subproject is a variable)</p>

<p>If you're working in a Lean project, then just put all your Lean files in <code>src</code> and you should be able to import any files in that directory.</p>

<p>I tried putting it directly in the <code>src</code> folder (not in a subfolder of <code>src</code>) but still got the error.</p>

<p>This seems to have resolved the issue. I'm confused why the other two things I tried (moving it to <code>src</code> and moving it into mathlib) didn't work though.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="261068">@ROCKY KAMEN-RUBIO</span>  You should never have to do something like this. Either you messed up or I messed up.</p>

<p>I cloned the tutorials project following instructions and can't reproduce this issue. It seems I didn't mess up.</p>

<p>Interesting. I'll poke around a little more. The error continues through the rest of the tutorials (but is fixed with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="252300">@Jalex Stark</span> 's suggestion).</p>

<p>But suggestion is precisely to stop "poking around". We can help you only if you describe which instructions you didn't follow.</p>
