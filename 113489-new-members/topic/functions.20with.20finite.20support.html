<p>I want to talk about an object which in my head has either type <code>f : M →. N </code> with <code>A : finset M</code> and <code>support f = a</code> (I don't actually know what I mean by <code>support</code>) or else has type <code>f : A → N</code> the latter doesn't work because A is not a type. I thought about trying to make <code>A</code> a subtype of <code>M</code> with an insteance <code>fintype A</code>, but I want to have <code>m : M</code> and reason about <code>m ∈ A : Prop</code>. Any advice? "Go read all of this particular file and you'll figure it out" would be fine.</p>

<p>Maybe the answer is "read fintype.basic", since fintype.of_finset looks like a good place for me to start.</p>
