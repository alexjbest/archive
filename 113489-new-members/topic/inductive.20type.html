<p>Hi! <br>
I am doing some stuff with mathematical logic in Lean and i would like to ask you the following. <br>
I have defined logic formulas as an inductive type with implication and negation (logic atoms are represented by natural numbers) the following way. </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>  <span class="kn">inductive</span> <span class="n">Form</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span>
  <span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">ℕ</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">Form</span>
  <span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">imp</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Form</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">Form</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">Form</span>
  <span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">neg</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Form</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">Form</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>I would like to somehow express the fact, that some formula B is a sub-formula of some other formula A.  That means, that either A = B or that somewhere during the process of creating formula A with the inductive rules, the formula B  is used (either in implication or negation (or even as a logical atom) ). Is there some way to express that? Cheers, Jachym</p>

<p>This could be an inductively defined Prop</p>
