<p>What is large elimination? What is subsingleton elimination? Why do we care about these? What do they have to do with proof irrelevance? What's so good about proof irrelevance anyway?</p>

<p>Some inductive propsition have a recursor that can make elements of a Type e.g. <code>eq</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>acc</code>. Others can only make a Prop, e.g. <code>exists</code> and <code>or</code>. eliminating into Type is call large elemination. If large elimination was allowed on <code>or</code> then the iota reduction rule would be inconsistent because of proof irrelevance, your function could return different values for <code>or.inl x</code> and <code>or.inr y</code>, even though <code>or.inl x.= or.inr y</code>. The Props with large elimination don't have this problem.</p>

<p>This is basically because they would be a subsingleton anyway, even if they were types. They only have one constructor, and all arguments are either props or are mentioned in the type of the output. There is a more precise rule for this somewhere.</p>

<p>I think other people can answer what is so good about proof irrelevance better than me, but one example is that <code>subtype.ext</code> would not hold without it.</p>
