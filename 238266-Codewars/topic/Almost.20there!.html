<p>So we now have 49 approved Lean kata - 1 to go before we can bug kazk again to consider moving Lean out of Beta <span aria-label="wink" class="emoji emoji-1f609" role="img" title="wink">:wink:</span> </p>
<p>As for the total number of kata (approved and beta), we now have 77 in Lean compared to 79 in Coq (and 50 in Agda, 24 in Idris). Well done! It should be noted that it took us just under 1.5 months to get to 77 kata in Lean, compared to about a year to get to 79 in Coq.</p>
