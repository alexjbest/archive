<p>Kevin Buzzard, Rob Lewis, Patrick Massot, and I have started working on a new tutorial introduction to Lean and mathlib, with help from Gabriel Ebner. It is here: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean</a>. The tutorial is meant to supplement other sources, like Kevin's Natural Number game, Patrick's tutorial, and TPIL. There is overlap. The goal is to provide as much useful learning material as possible for people looking to learn how to formalize mathematics and contribute to mathlib.</p>
<p>There is also an online version: <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/" title="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/</a>, but we recommend using the VS Code version. We hope to get some new chapters out quickly over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>In VS Code version, the examples and exercises are opened in an <code>examples</code> folder and you can save your work. Caveat: we don't yet have a good way of updating the tutorial without moving your files and resetting the repository or making a fresh copy. And the infrastructure may get additional bells and whistles. But in the meanwhile, the current version provides some fun exercises for people looking for things to do.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
