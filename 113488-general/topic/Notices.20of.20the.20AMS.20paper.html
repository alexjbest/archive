<p>NB I am not shouting about this paper on Twitter or anything yet -- this is a preliminary version (indeed there's still a TODO on p7 -- it would be great to hear from some people who know the state of analysis/geometry in Lean and who could supply some juicy theorem names if they're in master.</p>

<p>I've skimmed through the first one and a half pages and found a typo (or is it a pun?) on page 2. Near the end of subsection 1.1, it says, "At this stage in the development of mathematics, every proof can be chased right down to the axioms of the system we are considering, and students are expected to <em>lean</em> from such courses that mathematics can be done in this way." I suppose it should say "learn"?</p>

<p>I'm used to backwards reasoning since I'm more used to proving theorems in an ITP than on paper (my paper proofs are often unnecessarily long and verbose), but, strangely, I also initially thought the same as you did.</p>

<p>About the Lean example on pages 5-6 about the composition of two injective functions, perhaps it would be better to add a trailing comma to the last tactic invocation (<code>assumption</code>)? I would imagine that someone new to Lean stepping through the proof after clicking on the link might be confused that (s)he cannot see the "no goals" message right after the <code>assumption</code> since the theorem is already proven at that point.</p>

<p>Some (personal preference?) comments, overall I really enjoyed it, it is a really nice summary and call to arms.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about the introduction, I don't know the exact audience of the notices, but given that it is a bit broad and that notices is a coffee table type magazine, it might be better to make it clear that this is an example (whose details are not important for the article) from the get go rather than having people read two paragraphs about Galois deformations and Hida's hecke algebra to get going. Maybe swapping the first few paragraphs around would help, or add a hook, giving the reader a sense of where the article is going to draw them in?</p>
<p>"Just as a LATEX file is likely to contain some parts written<br>
in “maths mode”, a Lean file is likely to contain some<br>
parts written in “tactic mode”." - I don't understand the comparison here really, it makes it sound like the maths only happens in tactic mode, and at this point in the discussion I don't think term/tactic is relevant yet. The way I see it given that math-mode is the less readable to humans part of a TeX document, that makes it more analogous to term mode in some ways. (I see later you draw the comparison again and do mention term mode with a harder to read example, I feel like  you are using the term tactic mode really to mean all non-comment lean code). </p>
<p>I feel like it would be helpful to say more / give an example early when you say "The file might contain errors,<br>
for example perhaps a proof in the file is incomplete<br>
or incorrect, or a definition is not specified precisely<br>
enough." of a specific sort of way a proof can be incorrect people can relate to, "e.g. not all hypotheses are satisfied of a theorem that is applied, or some cases have not been checked"</p>
<p>"Suffice it to say" seems like a typo in section 2.</p>
<p>"open function -- giving us access to the concept of injectivity" - also seems like a needless complication at this point in the article (surely composition of injectivity is in the function namespace anyway ;) )</p>
<p>Probably you are aware or this is a placeholder but at the end of 3.1 there is an errant sentence "A Proposition is any true/false statement."</p>
<p>"Probably many of us are familiar with Sudoku"... I think you can just say "In the game Sudoku one .." :D</p>
<p>"Recall that a b : X" looks like there is a double space between : and X, weird</p>

<p>I really liked the paper as well! Here are some comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="127136">@Alex J. Best</span> about the first few sentences of the intro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the comments in the proof script jumped out at me:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>open function -- giving us access to the concept of injectivity</code>: maybe <code>-- lets us abbreviate function.injective as injective</code>? (This shows up twice)</li>
<li><code>import tactic -- tactic mode</code>: maybe <code>-- gives access to many useful tactics</code>? If you do want a "tactic mode" comment, it should go after <code>begin</code>.<br>
I know it's better not to get into the weeds with the code, but I could also see these comments leading to confusion in the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="113489" href="/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members">#new members</a> thread too...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rather than link directly to the Zulip chat (which will show a somewhat intimidating login screen), maybe we should link to <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/" title="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">https://leanprover-community.github.io/</a> instead? Actually, we should make a nice landing page for "Getting started with Lean": I like the text that's on the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-perfectoid-spaces/" title="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-perfectoid-spaces/">perfectoid project home page</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It might be nice to include an attractive illustration of a graph of some declarations in mathlib or something like that. (I'd volunteer, but I'm not convinced that I can produce anything suitable.)</p>
</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>As one solves the level, i.e., builds the proof,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there is no reference to Lean games or levels before this point, just Sudoku levels. But 'levels' in Sudoku seems an odd concept: it's not like eg Super Mario Bros. or Lean's Natural Number Game. There's just individual puzzles, they aren't levels in some overarching game.</p>

<p>That's a good list (I especially like the inverse function theorem). One could add the Banach open mapping theorem, or Arzela-Ascoli.</p>
