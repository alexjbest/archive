<p>There have been some work to redesign the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">Lean community website</a>, trying to make is a bit more friendly. There are probably a couple of things that went weird in the migration, so don't hesitate to report things here or, even better, open a PR at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/">the repository</a>. Ideas about improving the website are also welcome (especially if they come as ready to merge pull requests). Also don't hesitate to add things to <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/blob/newsite/lean.bib">the bib file</a>. Things tagged as either "about-lean", "about-mathlib" or "formalization" will appear on the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/papers.html">papers page</a>. You can also imitate Yury, Scott or SÃ©bastien trying to beat leanprover-community-bot at mathlib commits speed (last graph of <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_stats.html">this page</a>).</p>

<p>Wow! Even after hanging out here for a while I leaned several things</p>

<p>Good. I was thinking you will probably have ideas of things to add or tweak.</p>

<p>Hey this looks <em>really</em> good. Many thanks to whoever has done this. I was quite happy with the old version but this is even more user-friendly.</p>
