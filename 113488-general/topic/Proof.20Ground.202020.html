<p>Dear Lean enthusiasts,</p>
<p>we are organizing another edition of the proving competition workshop "Proof Ground", which will take place virtually.<br>
Please notice our Call for Problems, and spread the word!</p>

<p>at IJCAR 2020<br>
International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning<br>
June 29 - July 5, 2020,  (originally in) Paris, France, now fully virtual<br>

<p>This workshop brings together researchers of the ITP community to compete in a "proving contest".</p>
<p>While programming contests (e.g. ACM ICPC, International Olympiad in Informatics) challenge large numbers of participants to solve algorithmic problems within a short time, we envision proving contests to entice proof engineers to formally prove small but interesting problems from mathematics or computer science.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://competition.isabelle.systems/">contest system</a> is currently used for teaching and hosting proving contests in Coq, Isabelle, and Lean.</p>
<p>Proof Ground 2020 is part of the <a href="https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/summer-of-love-2020/">Paris Nord Summer of LoVe 2020</a>, a joint event on LOgic and VErification at Universit√© Paris 13, made of Petri Nets 2020, IJCAR 2020, FSCD 2020, and over 20 satellite events.</p>
<p>As the main conferences of Paris Nord Summer of LoVe will happen as virtual conferences due to the Covid-19 outbreak, Proof Ground will also take a purely virtual format.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www21.in.tum.de/~wimmers/proofground2019/">first edition</a> of the workshop has been held at <a href="https://itp19.cecs.pdx.edu/">ITP 2019</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Important Dates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Submission deadline: June 1, 2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workshop and Competition:  June 27, 2020</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Call for Problems</strong></p>
<p>In order to conduct a stimulating contest we solicit interesting tasks.</p>
<p>A contest typically lasts for two hours and consists of around five problems with varying difficulty.</p>
<p>A problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>should contain an informal statement of the problem together with a<br>
       template for the formal proof;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>should come with a reference solution (in any ITP);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>should be solvable (including formal proof) within 30 minutes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>should be easy to state in any proof assistant, without requiring<br>
       too much background library;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>could be from any part of mathematics, software verification, or<br>
       your daily work with ITPs, and could also be a logic puzzle/riddle;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>could contain several subproblems which lead to partial points.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions from (potential) competition participants are allowed.</p>
<p>Examples can be found at the current "Proving for Fun" contest system, e.g. <a href="https://competition.isabelle.systems/competitions/contest/6/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Submissions can be made via email to wimmers [at] in [dot] tum [dot] de by the date indicated above.</p>
