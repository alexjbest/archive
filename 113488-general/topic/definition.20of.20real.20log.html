<p>I have a controversial question (Kevin, close your eyes): how should we define the real logarithm of <code>x</code> when <code>x &lt; 0</code>. Currently, it is <code>0</code>, but I wonder if using <code>log |x|</code> would not be better, as it would satisfy the formulas <code>log(xy) = log x + log y</code> for all nonzero <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and <code>log' = 1/x</code> away from <code>0</code>. Given that proving that something is nonzero is often easier than checking its positivity, this would make these statements easier to apply. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>That would also make it equal to the real part of our complex log.</p>

<p>Ha ha I am over all this now. I remember Chris having problems with junk inputs with this definition but I can't remember the details. Isn't log|x| actually a useful function in fact? Isn't it the indefinite integral of 1/x for example?</p>

<p>I think we had a similar discussion about the output of sqrt many years ago when I was learning this stuff (I wrote real.sqrt before there was one in mathlib because I needed it for my undergraduate problem sheets)</p>

<p>I think Chris' observation was that exp (log (junk)) was not the traditional junk value of 0 but was actually 1</p>
