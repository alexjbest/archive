(I don't need/want to be one.) Given that our community is pretty active, it might be nice to have 6 ~ 8 admins, spread around the globe a bit (if possible). It's not that we need to moderate often. But if something comes up: better safe then sorry. I'll leave it to you to decide whether you want this, and which trusted members of the community you want to endow with more power (-;</p>

<p>The main reason I've kept it small is that there aren't actually that many things that a Zulip admin is required to do, demand is low (by contrast to mathlib maintainers, which are dealing with the flood of multiple PRs per day).</p>

<p>Also I don't think there has ever been an issue requiring immediate attention from an admin, so it's not a huge problem to wait for one to wake up.</p>

<p>There is no spam and no obnoxious users (yet) -- I don't quite know how we got away with this, maybe the community is just too small</p>

<p>Also, the number of times when a normal user needs to ask an admin to do something seems to be small as well, although recent ideas of Jalex and others has pushed this up a bit</p>

<p>perhaps the lack of anonymity contributes to the lack of trolling</p>

<p>The ideas have been good though so it's hardly onerous to implement them</p>
