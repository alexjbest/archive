<p>I am organising a Lean workshop in Freiburg (Germany), 13â€“17 July 2020.<br>
Some of you may have heard of the plans already during the Lean Together meeting in Pittsburgh. I've finally got the organisational hiccups worked out. So, if you are a mathematician, or you know a mathematician who is really interested in learning more about Lean, please let them know about this meeting: <a href="https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/" target="_blank" title="https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/">https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/</a></p>
<p>The plan is to have a couple of talks and tutorial sessions, but to also have ~50% of the time dedicated to hackathons and brainstorming sessions, or pair programming. Novices could team up with experts, to see how they go about setting up a theory, etc...</p>
<p>There is limited funding for PhD students and postdocs. Please let me know if you need this.<br>
In general, if you have any questions, please ask.</p>

<p>But since the plan was just a couple of talks and mostly hackathon, it might not be very different from what we are doing here on Zulip. And the "newbie sits next to expert to gets started" part of the program will go down the drain anyway.</p>
