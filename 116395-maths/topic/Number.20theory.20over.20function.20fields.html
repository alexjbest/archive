<p>I'd like to get more involved and plan to take on a research MSc student to help formalise results in number theory over function fields. For example, proving quadratic reciprocity, the Riemann Hypothesis, etc. in this setting.</p>
<p>Two questions for the experienced members:<br>
1) Has any of this been done? I can't see it in mathlib, but perhaps I'm not looking hard enough.<br>
2) In your opinion, is it a reasonable goal for an MSc dissertation?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I don't think we have anything in that direction. I'm not aware of anything involving function fields.</p>

<p>It depends very much on how much maths the student knows and how much experience they have with formalising maths.</p>

<p>If they don't have any prior experience... it might go well, but it might also be very tough.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span>. That's good to know. I can make a start to see how challenging it's likely to be before the start of the academic year in September.</p>
